# API Lab 4

As a part of a code clean-up I have only removed console logs and couple comments from my code. These were mostly used for debugging purposes and were not neccessary in the final code. I usually try to keep my code maintained and formatted through-out the whole time because I believe it makes the code more transparent and way easier to navigate though.
